</head>
<body>
    <pre>
        In JavaScript, Object is one of basic data types. To define an object you can use let obj = new Object() or let obj = {}.

You can define the object attributes during initialization, like this:

let animal = {name: "dog"}
you can also set/get some properties after the object definition, like this:

let animal = {}
animal.name = "dog"
// or:
animal["name"] = "dog"
Task
Give you a function animal, accept 1 parameter:obj like this:

{name:"dog",legs:4,color:"white"}
and return a string like this:

"This white dog has 4 legs."
